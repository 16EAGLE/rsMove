Why Develop rsMove?
In the scope of movement ecology, understanding the movement of an animal is dependent on our ability to compreeend the underlying environmental conditions that guides it. In this context, remote sensing becomes a fundamental tool. It provides information on the spatial and temporal variability of the landscape and provides us the means to understand the impact of environmental change over animal behavior. However, linking remote sensing and animal movement can be tricky.
