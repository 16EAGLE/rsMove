## rsMove



### Why Develop rsMove?
In the scope of movement ecology, understanding the movement of an animal is dependent on our ability to compreeend the underlying environmental conditions that guides it. In this context, remote sensing becomes a fundamental tool. It provides information on the spatial and temporal variability of the landscape and provides us the means to understand the impact of environmental change over animal behavior. However, linking remote sensing and animal movement can be tricky due to the differences in the spatial and temporal scales at which they are acquired (Figure 1). As a consequence, a simple point-to-raster query becomes insuficient creating a demand for data handling methods that are sensitive to the constraints imposed by remote sensing. **rsMove** Answers to this issue providing tools to query and analyze movement data using remote sensing that are sensitive to the spatial and temporal limitations of satellite based environmental predictors.
